This Android app vibrates the current time when the display is locked and you double-click the power button of your device.



How it works

Double-click the power button.  This might take some practice to work reliably. Press slowly and deliberately. If you
double-click too fast the system only recognizes a single click and turns the screen on instead.

The time vibration is structured as follows:

A short vibration stands for the digit 1 and a long one for the digit 5. The 2
is represented by two consecutive short vibrations, the 6 by a long and a short one and so
on. The 0 constitutes an exception with two long vibrations.


Examples:

* 01:18 =  .    .  -...
* 02:51 =  ..    -  .
* 10:11 =  .  --    .  .
* 19:06 =  .  -....    -.


Explanation:

The time is processed digit by digit:

* . = short vibration
* \- = long vibration

Leading zeros in the hour and minute fields are omitted.


Gaps:

To simplify the recognition of the vibration pattern, there exist three kind of gaps with different durations:

* \[\]: A short gap between vibrations in the same digit
* \[&nbsp;&nbsp;\]: A medium gap for the separation of two digits within the hour and minute field
* \[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\]: A long gap to split hours and minutes



Additional features

* Keep informed about the current time. The app can vibrate the current time automatically every X minutes or every hour.
* Play the [Greenwich Time Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Time_Signal) at the start of each hour, similar to a radio station.
* Decide what to do if you double-click when the display is on. You can choose between a warning vibration and having
  the time vibrated as well.
* The app is always ready, even after restarting your phone.
